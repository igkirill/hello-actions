# This workflow demonstrates how to run scripts in GitHub's cloud
# "on" defines when this workflow runs
on:
  push:
    branches: [ main, 'claude/**' ]  # Runs when you push to main or claude branches
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]                # Runs when you open a PR to main
  workflow_dispatch:                  # Adds a manual "Run workflow" button in GitHub UI

# "jobs" are the tasks that will run
jobs:
  # Job 1: Run our Python test script
  run-python-script:
    name: Run Python Test Script

    steps:
      # Step 1: Get your code from the repository

      # Step 3: Install required packages from requirements.txt
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: pip install -r requirements.txt

      # Step 4: Run our test script
      - name: Run the test script
        run: python app.py

      # Step 5: Upload the file created by our script
